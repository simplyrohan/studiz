# studiz
A lightweight tool to build, practice, and share flashcards seamlessly

## Origins
The English quiz is in 10 minutes. You have only read the first Chapter of the book. All your friends are bragging about how much they studied. You? You were up last night binge watching the new season of your favorite sitcom. This situation isn't rare, most students have experienced it several times. In these dire times, we find hope in Quizlet, the saving grace of our grades. You login, search for the flashcard set you need, click it, and now you are bombarded with 10 popups, a crashed page, and a pay-wall to upgrade. Finally after dodging everything, you can use the flashcards you were looking for, right? You practice them once, and go for another round. But wait, what's that? Nope, you can't practice them again, thats a *~premium~* feature. 

Why does it have to be like this? Why isn't there a plain simple app where I can practice and make flashcards, and share them. Enter `studiz`

Studiz is a lightweight, no nonsense, flashcard app to help you immediately get to studying. It has everything you need, persistant links, saved progress, editable cards, and more!

# Hosting
Studiz is a website, thats it! It's a static site, some HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. Slap it onto your favorite static host and you're good to go!
